<h2 data-nosnippet={true}>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>

As a Full Stack, DevSecOps, and Machine Learning Engineer with experience in diverse projects, I have a strong background in delivering secure, 
high-quality software empowered by AI. At CyDeploy Inc, I managed IT and IoT functional testing, developed .NET applications for 
Robotic Process Automation, and managed microservice deployments on cloud environments. In my part-time role at Warlock Tabletop, 
I designed, developed, and deployed secure software applications, while ensuring seamless integration and collaboration across the organization. 
My expertise in both roles demonstrates my ability to contribute effectively to any project, driving success and innovation.
