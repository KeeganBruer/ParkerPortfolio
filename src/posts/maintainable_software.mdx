Join me while I research and try to understand what makes code maintainable. A large part of maintainabilty is the documentation, 
so make sure you also check out my article ["The Importance Of Documentation"]("/Deepdive/importance_of_documentation")

## What makes software maintainable?

The most important factor in building maintainable software is to write unit tests. That way, you can be certain that when you try to change some features, 
that it doesn't cause unintended side effects across the codebase.

A large factor in designing a code-base is to separate your concerns and make sure the functions are not closely tied. This relates back to the data-flow section 
of the documentation, in that you ensure the inputs and outputs are solid and then the internal functionality can be maintained independently of each other. 
It's one of the reason's I enjoy micro-service architecture once the product includes enough interdependent functionalities. These micro-service endpoints 
can have a well defined data-flow and the implementation details can be maintained independently to the whole system.

## Conclusion

Even if your not working in web-dev or are working on a monolithic codebase, the "micro-service mindset" can be used in the form of a Model View Controller 
or other similar design concepts focusing on separation of concerns.
