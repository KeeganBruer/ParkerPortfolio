### Most Impactful Aspects of Software Engineering
When creating software, I prioritize building tested and maintainable codebases. To prioritize
these qualities, I believe it is crucial to begin each project by planning and writing meticulous
technical documentation. Then once you have a plan that clearly defines your intended
outcomes, use-cases, and data-flow; you can proceed forwards with your Test Driven
Development.

### My favorite part about software engineering
My favorite part about software engineering is the problem solving. I view programming through the
lens of puzzles, in that we use small building blocks laid out inside a framework to construct the
vision of our end product. These problem solving parts include the architectural design,
technical documentation, as well as the actual development itself. 

In regards to my least favorite part of software engineering, I would have to admit that I am not 
strong in my design skills. While I am capable of designing usable and functional interfaces, or 
implementing someone else's designs, I am not strong in the artistic side of design (choosing color 
schemes or deciding the layout).
