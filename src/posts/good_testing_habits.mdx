I find that unit testing is essential, especially when working on larger codebases. It helps catch easily avoidable adverse issues for new features. 
Also was a huge help when we rebuilt some of the legacy features, had specific use cases we wanted it to handle and used them as milestones to tackle. 
Now id have to mention that we still be missing edge cases so we couldn't fully rely on just the unit tests. I've also seen first hand how much integration 
tests can speed up feature turn around and maintaining user experience. 

## What Makes For A Good Test?



## What Habits Should You Develop?

As for habits, I like the idea of test driven development but often find that my structure changes as I start building the idea. 
My unit tests often start out as more of a way to see the structure and output of a functionality based on a few of the use-cases 
defined in the proposal. But towards the end of the feature, I find it a useful time investment to revisit the unit tests and refactor 
them into structured tests. As discussed above, this will save time in the long run and helps enforce the functionality of the proposal specified use-cases.
